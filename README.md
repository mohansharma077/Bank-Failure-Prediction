# Bank-Failure-Prediction
<h1>What do you mean by bank failure?</h1>
<p>A bank failure is when a bank is unable to meet its obligations to depositors and others because it has become insolvent or too illiquid to meet its liabilities. For example, if a bank has lent out more money than it can recover from its borrowers, it may not have enough money to pay back its depositors. When this happens, the bank may be closed by a federal or state regulator.</p><br/>

Modeling:

Use the sample data to answer:

• What was the biggest bank at the end of 2009?

• What trends do you observe in net chargeoffs over time?

• Is there a correlation between level of profitability of a bank’s investments in securities (here measured by fair value of investments over cost basis) and bank failure?

• What are the top two predictors of bank failure? • Which banks are most likely to fail in the near future (and why)?
