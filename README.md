# Bank-Failure-Prediction
<h1>What do you mean by bank failure?</h1>
<h4>A bank failure is when a bank is unable to meet its obligations to depositors and others because it has become insolvent or too illiquid to meet its liabilities. For example, if a bank has lent out more money than it can recover from its borrowers, it may not have enough money to pay back its depositors. When this happens, the bank may be closed by a federal or state regulator.</h4><br/>
<h4>Banks play a critical role in the economy by facilitating financial transactions, providing loans, and managing deposits. However, economic fluctuations, mismanagement, inadequate risk management practices, or external factors can lead to financial difficulties for banks, potentially resulting in failure. Bank failure prediction models aim to identify warning signs and indicators that could indicate the likelihood of such failures.</h4>

****Bank failure prediction can help address several problems in the short term, including****

**Early Warning System**
Bank failure prediction models serve as an early warning system to detect signs of financial distress in banks. By identifying potential risks and vulnerabilities, banks and regulatory authorities can take proactive measures to prevent failures and mitigate their impact.

**Risk Assessment:**
These models help assess the financial health and stability of banks by analyzing key indicators. This enables stakeholders, such as investors, depositors, and regulators, to make informed decisions regarding their involvement with a particular bank.

**Regulatory Oversight:**
Bank failure prediction models assist regulatory authorities in monitoring and supervising banks effectively. By identifying banks at risk of failure, regulators can implement appropriate regulatory measures, such as increased scrutiny, capital requirements, or intervention, to safeguard the financial system's stability.


**Economic Stability**
The failure of a bank can have significant ripple effects on the wider economy. It can disrupt lending activities, create financial panic, and lead to a loss of confidence in the banking system. By predicting bank failures, policymakers can implement timely interventions, such as providing liquidity support or facilitating bank resolutions, to minimize the negative impact on the economy.

**Early Warning Signals:**
Bank failure prediction models are designed to identify early warning signals of financial distress.

Modeling:

Use the sample data to answer:

• What was the biggest bank at the end of 2009?

• What trends do you observe in net chargeoffs over time?

• Is there a correlation between level of profitability of a bank’s investments in securities (here measured by fair value of investments over cost basis) and bank failure?

• What are the top two predictors of bank failure? • Which banks are most likely to fail in the near future (and why)?
